cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.5-ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now VMs are, by default, created from DTG-snapshot. This means we can build a VM in twenty three (23) seconds.
  * Currently, some of the magic is not working correctly. Specifically, the tricks to automagically create new templates fails, as dom0 cannot SSH into the guest, due to key issues that will be fixed at a later date.
