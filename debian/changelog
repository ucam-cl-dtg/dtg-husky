cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.11) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mattias Linnap ]
  * Move to DMZ script

  [ Oliver Chick ]
  * Remove the packaging stuff from the upstream branch. It should never have been there. Added in dd67085cd1555338c7d09809dcdf43e822819d17 by mistake

  [ Thomas Bytheway ]
  * Updated script shebang line to use /usr/bin/env rather than direct interpreter reference.

  [ Oliver Chick ]
  * Delete me
  * Added documentation to the prepare_vm method
  * added missing fullstops to comments
  * Removed the default name of "" from new_vm, and the test for this value being "".
  * Run the vm-boot script after changing the hostname. This will fix /etc/hosts
  * Reduced the value of {static,dynamic} minimum memory to be 256MiB.

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.10) precise; urgency=low

  * Change VCPUs-max befoe VCPUss-at-startup
  * Change root FS size to 8GB. 4GB is proving to be too small
  * Use root account, not dtg for SSHing into to change the hostname

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.9) precise; urgency=low

  * Fetch latest puppet config from gitlab before running puppet on new VMs

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.8) precise; urgency=high

  * Changed location of preseed file to be on git.dtg, we can therefore remove stuff from the dhcp puppet config

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.7) precise; urgency=low

  * Changed the default VM config, so by default, VMs now have 1 VCPU and 512MB of RAM. These can easily be overriden - see -h for information.
  * Fixed bug that made the script die when a VM is built using 1 VCPU
  * Added magic for SSHing to VMs, setting the hostname and forcing a puppet update, so that you get any config that is dependent on hostname
  * Use socket.gethostbyaddr, rather than shelling out. This is much nicer. WHy didn't I do this before?
  * Tidy up of imports, including removing some duplicates

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.6) precise; urgency=low

  * Change the help associated with the memory command, so it correctly says that memory is specified in MB, not GB
  * Loop until an IP address is found, then print it. This is much better than just waiting 10 seconds
  * Hide the output of the script. Therefore all that we now have printed (if all goes well) is the IP address of the new machine. Therefore you easily do magic where stdout is piped into another command.

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.5-ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now VMs are, by default, created from DTG-snapshot. This means we can build a VM in twenty three (23) seconds.
  * Currently, some of the magic is not working correctly. Specifically, the tricks to automagically create new templates fails, as dom0 cannot SSH into the guest, due to key issues that will be fixed at a later date.

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.4) precise; urgency=low

  * Now uses argparse to get options in a more conventional UNIX tools way. Run cl-dtg-make-vm -h for help.

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.3) precise; urgency=low

  * Modification to cl-dtg-make-vm to build VMs with two disks. xvda is used for storing the OS, and xvdb is used for storing /local/data.

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.2) precise; urgency=low

  * No functional change. Modification to build system so launchpad imports from github, and produces a package

 -- Oliver Chick <oc243@cl.cam.ac.uk>  Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:59:56 +0000

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.1) precise; urgency=low
