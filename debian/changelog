cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.18) raring; urgency=low

  * Added the capture-vm-snapshot script, which is used to turn a VM into a template.
  * Don't use camel case
  * Don't echo $ip
  * Check number of args, before using $1
  * Check only one VM with that name label before doing anything with it
  * Move user constant to top of file
  * We need to SSH in as root, not dtg
  * Don't die on errors, we want to keep trying SSH until it works.
  * Keep trying to SSH into the newly created VM, until we get in. Then spin until puppet stops running.
  * Specify the owner and deleteable by early on.
  * More specific variable naming
  * Add comment explaining why we disable host key checks
  * Rename cl-dtg-make-vm.py to cl-dtg-make-vm, and remove the symlink.
  * Implement the -r option, and rename /dev/xvda
  * Rename capture-vm-snapshot to dom0-vm-to-template.sh

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.17) raring; urgency=low

  * Run apt-get update on each VM after setting the hostname, and before puppet applying.
  * Change location of dhcp to dhcp.dtg, and specify the usernames for dom0 and dhcp.dtg
  * SPecify default values in argparse
  * Specify the host that check_name should run on (dom0)
  * Don't assume that we already have a valid iP
  * Rely on fabric state to reduce verbosity
  * Run check_name as a separate fabric task, to decouple checking a name from making a vm
  * Use fabric's execute function to avoid shelling out to the fabric cli mode.
  * Move responsibility for finding a free mac address from dom0 to the local machine executing a fab task.
  * Split up the make tasks to differentiate between the parts taht run on dom0 and the parts that run locally

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.15) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Fixing a bug whereby cl-dtg-find-vm would not find a VM whose name contains a space.
  * Updated tempalte UUID, after it was regenerated following the update to 6.2

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.14) precise; urgency=low

  [ Andrew Rice ]
  * cl-dtg-rm-vm: added a check to ensure that you are the owner of a vm you try to delete
  * Fixed capitalisation of vm to VM
  * Changed the name-description parameter of the VM to hold only the DNS name, moved owner to a XenCenter.Customfield
  * Used a new parameter deletable-by to indicate who can delete a VM.  By default it is set to owner.

  [ Oliver Chick ]
  * Case insensitive matching on mac addresses.

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.13) precise; urgency=low

  [ Oliver Chick ]
  * Checks that VM names are not already used before creating a new one with the same name.
  * Set the VM description as its puppy number for cloned machines.
  * Don't count lines. Just see if the string is empty
  * Added the crsid of the VM's creator to the description.
  * Remove a race condition in the ordering of SSH commands. The condition could result in a VM not getting the most up-to-date puppet config on creation. An error is thrown by cl-dtg-make-vm when this occurs.

  [ Andrew Rice ]
  * New script to work out what the DNS name of a VM is by finding its MAC, working out what IP it has from dhcp and then doing a reverse lookup

  * Initial checkin of a script to remove a VM and delete its disks
  * Removed unused imports
  * Style: Fixed whitespace around equals-sign

  [ Mattias Linnap ]
  * Move to DMZ script

  [ Oliver Chick ]
  * Remove the packaging stuff from the upstream branch. It should never have been there. Added in dd67085cd1555338c7d09809dcdf43e822819d17 by mistake

  [ Thomas Bytheway ]
  * Updated script shebang line to use /usr/bin/env rather than direct interpreter reference.

  [ Oliver Chick ]
  * Delete me
  * Added documentation to the prepare_vm method
  * added missing fullstops to comments
  * Removed the default name of "" from new_vm, and the test for this value being "".
  * Run the vm-boot script after changing the hostname. This will fix /etc/hosts
  * Reduced the value of {static,dynamic} minimum memory to be 256MiB.

  * Change VCPUs-max befoe VCPUss-at-startup
  * Change root FS size to 8GB. 4GB is proving to be too small
  * Use root account, not dtg for SSHing into to change the hostname

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.9) precise; urgency=low

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.8) precise; urgency=high

  * Changed location of preseed file to be on git.dtg, we can therefore remove stuff from the dhcp puppet config

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.7) precise; urgency=low

  * Changed the default VM config, so by default, VMs now have 1 VCPU and 512MB of RAM. These can easily be overriden - see -h for information.
  * Fixed bug that made the script die when a VM is built using 1 VCPU
  * Added magic for SSHing to VMs, setting the hostname and forcing a puppet update, so that you get any config that is dependent on hostname
  * Use socket.gethostbyaddr, rather than shelling out. This is much nicer. WHy didn't I do this before?
  * Tidy up of imports, including removing some duplicates

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.6) precise; urgency=low

  * Change the help associated with the memory command, so it correctly says that memory is specified in MB, not GB
  * Loop until an IP address is found, then print it. This is much better than just waiting 10 seconds
  * Hide the output of the script. Therefore all that we now have printed (if all goes well) is the IP address of the new machine. Therefore you easily do magic where stdout is piped into another command.

cl-dtg-make-vm (0.0.5-ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now VMs are, by default, created from DTG-snapshot. This means we can build a VM in twenty three (23) seconds.
  * Currently, some of the magic is not working correctly. Specifically, the tricks to automagically create new templates fails, as dom0 cannot SSH into the guest, due to key issues that will be fixed at a later date.
